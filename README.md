## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deep3123/portfolio.git

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd portfolio

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   or
   yarn install

### Development
To start the development server and view the website:

    npm run dev
    or
    yarn dev

This will start the Vite development server. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your portfolio website.

### Building for Production
To build the optimized production bundle:

    npm run build
    or
    yarn build

This command generates optimized production-ready files in the dist directory. These files are minified, bundled, and ready to be deployed to a web server.

## Customization
Updating Content:

1. Modify the components in the src/components directory to update the structure and content of your website.
2. Update the data files, such as src/data/projects.js, to include details about your projects.
3. Customize the styling using Tailwind CSS utility classes or extend with your own CSS in src/styles.

## Deployment
Deploy your built dist folder to your hosting provider of choice. Ensure your hosting environment supports single-page applications (SPAs) if you're using client-side routing.
